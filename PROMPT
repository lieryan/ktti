Technical Exercise to be completed at home:

Create an accounting system to manage pending and settled transactions.

This exercise will test your ability to implement a simple accounting system
that tracks pending and settled transactions.

Pending transactions reduce the available balance but are treated differently
from settled transactions.  While a particular transaction is pending, a
partial or full refund can be applied, which reduces the amount of funds
pending.

For this exercise, build a CLI system that allows for the following:
- Creating an account
- Creating a pending transaction
- Settling a pending transaction
- Refunding part or all of a pending transaction
- Calculating the available balance (settled + pending)
- Listing all transactions for an account

BONUS:
- guard against double spending
- guard against over spending

We recommend researching similar systems before starting to code. How have
others implemented accounting ledger systems? Are there good practices around
modeling pending transactions? How should you model debit vs. credit
transactions and the direction of money? Should you decide to have one ledger
or many?

You are free to use any technology and programming language of your choice.
The purpose of this exercise is to help us determine if you are the right
candidate for this role.
